/**
*  Function:	getDateTimeString
*
*  Use:			Public
*
*  Description:	Returns a character date and character time from a julian date and time in seconds past midnight.
*
*  Declaration: void getDateTimeString (int julian, char *dateString, size_t sizeofDateString, int dateStyle,
					    int secondsPastMidnight, char *timeString, size_t sizeofTimeString, int timeStyle);
*
*  Parameters:	int julian
*					Date in days since 01Jan1900, with 01Jan1900 being day 1 (31Dec1899 is day 0)
*					This is the standard day count used throughout DSS and can be negative (or large).
*					An undefined day is the number "-2147483647".  Note, 0 (zero) is valid day and used a lot!
*
*				char *dateString (output)
*					A String to containt the current date.  Should be declared large enough to hold style (below).
*					Examples:  "05Apr1976" (Style 4), "6/2/1985" (Style -101)
*
*				size_t sizeofDateString
*					The size of dateString passed in.  Should include space for null terminator.
*
*				int dateStyle
*					The style code of how the data should be returned, as given below in the table.
*					dateStyle "4" is the standard date style used by DSS (e.g., "02Jun1985").
*
*				int secondsPastMidnight
*					The current time of day in seconds past midnight.
*					"1" is one second past midnight.  "0" doesn't exist, as midnight belongs to the end
*					of the day, by convention, and midnight is the number "86400".
*					secondsPastMidnight varies from 1 to 86400.
*
*				char *timeString (output)
*					A string to contain the complete current time.  Must be dimensioned to hold string with null term.
*					Example time string: "08:23:12".
*
*				size_t sizeofTimeString
*					The size of timeString.  Should be at least 13.
*
*				int timeStyle
*					The style code of how the time should be returned, as given below in the table.
