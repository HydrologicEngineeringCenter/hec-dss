/**
*  Function:	isTimeInRange
*
*  Use:			Private
*
*  Description:	 Determine if the time value given is in range of the specified time window.
*					Used in irregular-interval processes
*
*  Declaration: int isTimeInRange(int timeValue, int *lastValueStatus, int timeGranularitySeconds,
*								  int baseDate, ztsTimeWindow *timeWindow);
*
*  Parameters:	int timeValue
*					The time value to compare, in timeGranularitySeconds (minutes or seconds) from baseDate.
*
*				int *lastValueStatus
*					(Input and output) Flag indicating if value is before, in or after
*					time window.  Uses as input and returns for this value
*						*lastValueStatus < 0:   previous time was before time window
*						*lastValueStatus == 0:  previous time was within time window
*						*lastValueStatus > 0:   previous time was after time window (and probably break)
*
*				int timeGranularitySeconds
*					The number of seconds a unit in timeValue represents, usually
*					MINUTE_GRANULARITY (60) or SECOND_GRANULARITY (1)
*
*				int baseDate
*					The julian base date (days since Jan 01, 1900) for this time.
*
*				ztsTimeWindow *timeWindow
*					The time window to compare to.
*
*
*  Returns:		boolInRange
*		 			Zero (false), if not within range
*					One (true) if within range
*
*	Remarks:	This function is a convenience function used to quickly test if a time is
*					within the requested time window, for irregular interval date.
*					timeGranularitySeconds is usually 60 for minutes,
*					but often 1 for seconds, and also can be larger
*					for very long time spans (3600 for hours, etc.)
