/**
*  Function:	zundelete
*
*  Use:			Public
*
*  Description:	Marks a single deleted as good in a DSS file.   Version 6 and 7.
*
*  Declaration: int zundelete(long long *ifltab, const char *pathname);
*
*  Parameters:	long long ifltab
*					An integer array dimensioned to int*8 [250] that contains file specific information.
*					This should be considered as a "handle" array and must be passed to any function that accesses that file.
*
*				const char *pathname
*					The pathname of the record to be undeleted.
*
*	Note:		A deleted record cannot be undeleted in version 7 file that uses space reclamation.
*					If you really need the data, you can try turning reclamation off, then undelete.
*					If space has been reclaimed since deletion, then the data set may be bad.
*					A file squeeze will remove all deleted records (and cannot be undeleted after that).
*
*	Remarks:	A delete only marks a record as deleted.  It physically deleted on a squeeze or the
*					area is reused by reclamation.
*					You can use the catalog function to determine deleted records in a DSS file.  You can
*					call zundeleteAll to undelete all records that have been deleted.
*
