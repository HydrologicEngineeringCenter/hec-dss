/**
*  Function:	ztsTimeMessage
*
*  Use:			Private
*
*  Description:	Convience function to print debug messages with time information.
*
*  Declaration: void ztsTimeMessage(long long *ifltab, const char *message, int timeMinOrSec, int timeGranularitySeconds, int julianBaseDate)
*
*  Parameters:	long long *ifltab
*					The file table array, similar to a handle number
*
*				const char *message
*					The message to print.
*
*				int timeMinOrSec
*					The time value to convert to character, given either in minutes since baseDate, or
*					seconds since baseDate.
*					"1" is one second past midnight.  "0" doesn't exist, as midnight belongs to the end
*					of the day, by convention, and midnight is the number "86400".
*					secondsPastMidnight varies from 1 to 86400.
*
*				int timeGranularitySeconds
*					The number of seconds each unit in timeMinOrSec represents,
*					MINUTE_GRANULARITY (60) or SECOND_GRANULARITY (1)
*
*				int julianBaseDate
*					The Julian base date, which when appropriatly aded to the time, give the full correct
*					date and time.
*
*	Returns:	None
