/**
*  Function:	zgetRecordSize6
*
*  Use:			Private;  use zgetRecordBasics instead
*
*  Description:	Function to get basic information about a single record, such as type, version, last written, etc
*
*  Declaration: int zgetRecordBasics6(long long *ifltab, zStructRecordBasics *recordBasics);
*
*  Parameters:	long long ifltab
*					The file table array, similar to a handle number.
*
*				zStructRecordBasics *recordbasics
*					A struct will contain information for a single record.
*					See zStructRecordBasics.h for description of zStructRecordBasics contents
*					This struct is created by the following method:
*						zStructRecordBasics* zstructRecordBasicsNew(const char* pathname);
*					When you are finished with the struct, the struct must be freed by a call to
*						void zstructFree(zStructRecordBasics *recordBasics)
*					NEVER REUSE A zStructRecordBasics, always free and create a new on.
*
*
*	Remarks:	zgetRecordBasics() is the public function.

*
*	See Also:	int zgetRecordSize (long long *ifltab, zStructRecordSize *recordSize);
*					int ztsGetSizes(long long *ifltab, zStructTimeSeries *tss,
*						zStructRecordSize *timeSeriesRecordSizes)
*					Which gives the combined sizes for a group of time series records
*					spanning the time window defined in zStructTimeSeries
