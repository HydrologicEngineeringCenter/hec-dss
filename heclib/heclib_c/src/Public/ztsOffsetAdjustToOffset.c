/**
*  Function:	ztsOffsetAdjustToOffset
*
*  Use:			public
*
*  Description:	Takes a date / time and adjusts it to the date / time for the offset given.
*
*  Declaration: int ztsOffsetAdjustToOffset(int offsetSeconds, int intervalSeconds, int *julian, int *seconds);
*
*  Parameters:	int offsetSeconds
*					The time offset to adjust to, in seconds.
*
*				int intervalSeconds
*					The time interval, in seconds.  This must be a standard interval, as shown below.
*
*				int julianStart (input - output)
*					The julian day.
*
*				int secondsStart (input - output)
*					The time, in seconds.
*
*
*	Returns:	int status:
*					STATUS_OKAY
*					STATUS_NOT_OKAY - invalid interval.
*
*	Remarks:	The time offset is given in seconds from the START of the interval.
*				This is because for intervals of different length (e.g., monthly),
*				the end of the interval is ragged and the day would be different for
*				each month.
*	Comments:
*				DSS "standard time" is considered End of Period (EOP),
*				e.g., midnight or 2400 hours for daily data.
*				If, on standard time, the offset is zero.
*				If not, then the offset is time from the standard time
*				to the reported time (for compatibility with version 6).
*				For example, for daily data, if the data is reported at
*				0100 (1 a.m.), the offset is 1 hour, or 3600 seconds.
*				If data is reported at 2300 (11 p.m.), the offset is
*				23 hours or 23 * 3600 = 82800 seconds.
*				(The offset is not the difference between the reported time
*				to the standard time, but standard to reported.)
