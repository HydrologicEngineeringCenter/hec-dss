*  Function:	getEndian
*
*  Use:			Private (Internal)
*
*  Description:	Gets the endian-ness for this OS / Chip
*
*  Declaration: int getEndian();
*
*
*	Returns:
*				Zero (0) for Little Endian
*				One (1) for Big Endian
*
*	Remarks:	Endianness is how low level bytes are ordered, and is a
*					reminiant of the history of the chip
*					Big endian is for Sun Solairs / RISC chips.  Bytes are stored in this order:
*						12345678
*					Little endian is for Windows / Intel chips.  Bytes are stored in this order:
*						87654321
